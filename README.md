# Frost
A math utility module made for Fennel. ðŸª´ Fennel is an open-source Lua like-Lisp language.
With the functions and syntax that fennel has provided, I thought why not copy my Roblox model into fennel.
Therefore, this is a replicated version of my Theorist math library for Roblox!
In my opinion, you should definetly start using Fennel. Here is the link to their website: https://fennel-lang.org

>This is a module, and similarly to Lua, you must require modules.
Fennel, however is a bit different, as it is similar to Lisp

## Using Frost
Since Frost is known as a module, you will need to require it! Of course, however... You must have nothing to require as you haven't installed it. So I will walk you through how to install it. Go to the releases page, and then press the latest release! Now, you press on the ```.fnl``` file you see. You can now add the code to a workspace, and then use it and/or modify it. Like Lua, you need to require the module to use it. You can require it by doing:
```fnl
(local Frost (require :Frost))
```
As you can see, it is similar to Lua, in which you require modules.
Now, you have full access to the math library, Frost. Feel free to use any functions as you wish.
If you want to learn how to use these functions, you can visit my documentation here:

## Methods
So, Frost has a lot of like functions so i'll go over them rn ðŸ˜‹!
It has a bunch of functions for adding and subtracting and basically all basic operations, to make math in fennel well a bit easier. So erm just play around with them.
I will not be releasing an official documentation for this as it is not a bit project just a utility thingy x.

## Note
Tysm for viewing my work. If ya like follow me and star to see more. I will not be looking at any pulls as I generally am leaving this shit alone.

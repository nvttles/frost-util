# Frost
A math utility module made for Fennel. ðŸª´ Fennel is an open-source Lua like-Lisp language.
With the functions and syntax that fennel has provided, I thought why not copy my Roblox model into fennel.
Therefore, this is a replicated version of my Theorist math library for Roblox!
In my opinion, you should definetly start using Fennel. Here is the link to their website: https://fennel-lang.org
